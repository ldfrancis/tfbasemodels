This repository contains implementation for deep learning models in tensorflow. In most cases, it uses model weights from official/other implemantations (weight sources would be specified when needed). I aim to implement most deep learning models and make them readily available for use. This implementations would start with image classification models and then proceed to other deep learning models.

## Available implementations
### Image Classification
- LeNet5 (no weights)
- AlexNet (no weights)
- ZFNet (no weights)
- VGG16, VGG19 ([weight source](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models/releases/))
- ResNet18, ResNet32, ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152
- ResNet18v2, ResNet32v2, ResNet50v2, ResNet101v2, ResNet152v2
