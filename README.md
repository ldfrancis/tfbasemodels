# tfbasemodels
tfbasemodels aims to ease the building and training of custom deep learning models. It includes my attempt to implement popular deep learning models in tensorflow.
The rigour encountered in this attempt inspired the idea to build a [GUI application](https://github.com/ldfrancis/tfbasemodelsUI) for neural network architecture design.

## Available implementations
### Image Classification
- LeNet5 (no weights)
- AlexNet (no weights)
- ZFNet (no weights)
- VGG16, VGG19 ([weight source](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models/releases/))
- ResNet18, ResNet32, ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152
- ResNet18v2, ResNet32v2, ResNet50v2, ResNet101v2, ResNet152v2
- ResNext50(32-4d), ResNext101(32-4d)
